# Federated Learning

Federated Learning is a new subarea of machine learning where the training process is distributed among many users.
Instead of sharing their data, users only have to provide weight updates to the server.

This repository contains the code for the experiments and simulations related to Federated Learning that I'm running at Mozilla.
More information about the plans for using Federated Learning at Mozilla can be found on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1462102).
The results of these experiments are going to be the basis for the experimental part of my master's thesis.
